Developed a Telegram bot using the Aiogram framework, designed to guide users through a structured data input process. The bot interacts with users, collecting information on various security services, which is then stored in an SQL Server database. The project involved creating dynamic menus, managing user states with FSM (Finite State Machine), and ensuring a seamless user experience. The bot also provides options for users to skip fields and return to previous menus, emphasizing flexibility and user-friendliness.
